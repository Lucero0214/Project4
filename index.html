<h1>Pet Friendly</h1>
<p>Dogs truly are man’s (and woman’s) best friend—in fact, half of American households own pets, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Many people love their dog like a family member and look forward to seeing their wagging tail every day after work. Though many people would do anything for their canine friends, few consider their pets when making decisions about where to live. However, there are significant benefits of a dog park in the community, and taking that into consideration when planning your move might end up being more valuable than you think.</p>
