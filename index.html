<h1>Pet Friendly</h1>
<p>Dogs truly are man’s (and woman’s) best friend—in fact, half of American households own pets, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Many people love their dog like a family member and look forward to seeing their wagging tail every day after work. Though many people would do anything for their canine friends, few consider their pets when making decisions about where to live. However, there are significant benefits of a dog park in the community, and taking that into consideration when planning your move might end up being more valuable than you think.</p>

      <p>All department of Youth, Parks, & Community Enrichment dog parks are fenced, with a double-gate system for safety. Dog owners can test their arm strength and even use tennis ball launchers to get their dogs active and running in a safe and fun environment. Parks include: benches, shade areas, drinking fountains for dogs, and plenty of room to run. Dogs of all sizes are welcome</p>
      <p>Exercise and socialization are two key ingredients to making a dog healthy and happy. A dog park is a great place to make this happen! Dog parks provide recreational and social opportunities for dogs as well as people. A well-socialized dog is a safer dog in our community. </p>
